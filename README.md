# Diagnosis-of-Diabetic-Retinopathy-using-Stacked-CNN-and-Gray-world-

In this project we aim to diagnoise diabetic retinopathy using Gray World Color Constancy Algorithm and Stacked generalisation of three different Convolutional Neural Networks and draw Comparitive analysis with pretrained Transfer Learning Models such as resNet50 and VGG-16
